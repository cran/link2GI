## link2GI 0.3-0
The 0.3-0  version is quite restructured to conform to both 
common R conventions (e.g. no hidden globals) and to make the calls 
more intuitive and one-line-like. some of the function follow a slightly 
different naming and argument setting. This was done to keep in line with further 
CLI linking functionality.

* Linux support for multi-version selection
* remove all global variables (re-opened issue #3)
* homogenization of the link calls
