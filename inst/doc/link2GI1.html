<h1 id="what-is-link2gi">What is link2GI?</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=link2GI">link2GI</a> package provides a small linking tool to simplify the use of <code>GRASS GIS</code>, <code>SAGA GIS</code>, <code>Orfeo Toolbox</code> (<code>OTB</code>) and <code>GDAL</code> binaries for R users, with the focus on making this software accessible to non-operating system specialists or highly experienced GIS geeks.  In fact, it is a direct result of numerous graduate courses with R(-GIS) novices in the hostile world of university computer pools running on extremely limited Windows systems.</p>
<p>This vignette:</p>
<ul>
<li>shows how to use <code>link2GI</code> according to specific system requirements</li>
<li>gives some practical examples of how to use it</li>
<li>gives some applied examples for more efficient spatial analysis</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-link2gi-now">Why link2GI now?</h1>
<p>R has a lot of classes for storing and manipulating spatial data. For vector data, the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp">sp</a> and currently the great <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf">sf</a> packages are well known, and the raster data world is largely covered by the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=terra">terra</a> and recently the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars">stars</a> packages. For more specific links, such as those needed for manipulating atmospheric models, packages like <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4">ncdf4</a> are very helpful.</p>
<p>The spatial analysis itself is often supported by wrapper packages that integrate external libraries, command line tools, or a mixture of both in an R-like syntax <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geosphere">geosphere</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Distance">Distance</a>, <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph">igraph</a>, or <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatstat">spatstat</a>.</p>
<p>A comprehensive introduction to the spatial R-biotope and its backgrounds is excellently treated in <a href="https://r.geocompx.org/">Geocomputation with R</a>, which is not only highly recommended as a reference book, but is also an indispensable basis for working and analyzing spatial data with R/Python.</p>
<p>Despite all these spatial analysis and data handling capabilities in the <code>R</code> world, it can be said (at least from a non-R point of view) that there is still a huge gap between R and the mature open source Geographic Information System (GIS) and even more so the Remote Sensing (RS) software community. QGIS, GRASS GIS, and SAGA GIS provide an extensive, growing, and mature collection of sophisticated algorithms. The algorithms provided are fast, stable and most of them are well proven. Probably most <code>R</code> users who are somehow connected to the GI community know that there are great wrapper packages to bridge this gap. For <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">GRASS GIS ⅞</a> it is <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgrass">rgrass</a> and for <a href="https://saga-gis.sourceforge.io/">SAGA GIS</a> it is the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSAGA">RSAGA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stevenpawley/Rsagacmd"><code>Rsagacmd</code></a> packages.
Since there is also no wrapper for the Orfeo Toolbox, which is indispensable in exploration, it is also very helpful to provide a lightweight wrapper for the use of <code>OTB</code> modules from <code>R</code>..</p>
<p>Unfortunately you will run into a lot of technical problems depending on the chosen operating system (OS) or library dependencies or GIS software versions. In the case of <code>RSAGA</code> for example, the main problem was that the <code>SAGA</code> GIS developers not only change the syntax and strategy of the command line interface (CLI), but also within the same release the calls differ from OS to OS. So the maintenance of RSAGA is at least tedious (but thumbs up again).  Another example is <code>GRASS GIS</code>, which is known for a sophisticated setup of the environment and the spatial properties of the database. If you “only” want to use a specific <code>GRASS</code> algorithm from R, you will probably get lost in setting up all the OS dependencies that are necessary to set up a correct temporary or permanent <code>GRASS</code> environment from “outside”. This is not only due to the strict space and projection requirements of <code>GRASS</code>, but much more due to the demanding OS environments, especially Windows.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, it is a bit cumbersome to deal with all this stuff when you just want to start <code>GRASS</code> from the R command line, e.g. for a powerful random walk cost analysis (<code>r.walk</code>) call as provided by <code>GRASS</code>.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-linking-mean">What does linking mean?</h1>
<p>Linking simply means to provide all the necessary environment settings to satisfy the existing wrapper packages as well as full access to the command line APIs of the mentioned software tools. <code>link2GI</code> tries to analyze which software is installed in order to create a temporary environment that satisfies the above mentioned requirements.</p>
<h3 id="grass-gis">GRASS GIS</h3>
<p>GRASS GIS has the most demanding requirements. It needs a lot of environment and path variables as <strong>and</strong> a correct setup of the geographic data parameters. The <code>linkGRASS</code> function tries to find all installations and lets you (optionally) choose the one you want to use and generate the necessary variables. As a result you can use both the <code>rgrass</code> package and the command line <code>API</code> of <code>GRASS</code>.</p>
<h3 id="saga-gis">SAGA GIS</h3>
<p>SAGA GIS is much easier to set up. Again, the <code>linkSAGA</code> function will try to find all <code>SAGA</code> installations, let you (optionally) choose one, and generate the necessary variables. You can also use <code>RSAGA</code>, but you have to pass the result of <code>linkSAGA</code> like <code>RSAGA::rsaga.env(path = saga$sagaPath)</code>. For easy use you can just use the <code>R</code> system() call to interface <code>R</code> with the <code>saga_cmd</code> API.</p>
<h3 id="orfeo-toolbox-otb">Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)</h3>
<p>The <code>Orfeo Toolbox</code> (OTB) is a very powerful remote sensing toolbox. It is widely used for classification, filtering and machine learning applications. You will find some of the implemented algorithms in various R packages, but <strong>always</strong> much slower or only running on small data chunks. <code>link2GI</code> searches and links all <code>OTB</code> installations of a given search path and returns the result as a concise list.  Due to a missing wrapper package, a list-based <code>OTB</code> module and function parser is also available, which can be piped into the <code>runOTB</code> function for a convenient function call.</p>
<h3 id="gdal">GDAL</h3>
<p>Although <code>GDAL</code> is perfectly integrated into R, in some cases it is advantageous to use system calls and grab the binaries directly. In particular, the evolution to <code>GDAL 3.x</code> and optionally different boxed versions of <code>GDAL</code> binaries working with different <code>Python</code> and <code>proj4/proj6</code> libs makes it sometimes difficult to grab the correct version of <code>GDAL</code>.  link2GI<code>generates a list of all paths and commands of all</code>GDAL` installations in the given search path.  With this list you can easily use all available API calls of each installation.</p>
