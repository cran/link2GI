# README


Note: For small projects, all code can go to the `<projectname>-main.R` file except the main project setup script.
For large projects, this file should **only** call other sub-control files and/or functions.
To add a script using link2GI see ?link2GI::addScript.

In order to have the standard packages and the project structure available, the `main.R` script must be called. 

It automatically sources the file `000_setup.R`, which contains the basic settings for the selected setup type. 

These can of course be extended manually and adapted to the respective requirements.  The paths to the directories are stored in the dir` list
