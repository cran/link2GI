\title{Bridges to the GI-World}
\description{
A straightforward helper tool for linking  GI/RS functionality to R. The goals of the package 
are to correctly initialize both the existing wrapper packages \code{rgrass7} and \code{RSAGA} and
to smoothly enable the necessary system variables and path parameters for a direct access of the binaries 
via system calls on all operating systems. In particular, \code{rgrass7} and \code{RSAGA} can cause severe 
problems during initialization of parallel installations of \code{GRASS GIS} or \code{SAGA GIS} under the
Windows operating system(s). \code{link2GI} tries to set the correct system settings and returns if system 
calls are required the necessary paths and commands. \cr
Furthermore the package provides a linkage to the Orfeo Toolbox software as well as a basic list based command parser.
\cr\cr
In addition there are some usefull functions for creating project folder structures, direct reading and 
writing of GRASS vector data and manual building of the package in UNC related enviroments.

Functions for linking  GI/RS functionality to R
}
\note{
To utilize the power of the open source GI tools from within \code{R} you need to installthem first.
The link2GI package just tries to generate correct environment settings as system and path variables
for the most of the known issues. 
 As a first promising opportunity to do fullfil most of the requirements you may install \code{QGIS, GRASS GIS 7.x} 
 and \code{SAGA-GIS} following the excellent 
 \href{https://github.com/jannes-m/RQGIS/blob/master/vignettes/install_guide.Rmd}{installation instructions}  
 of the \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RQGIS}{RQGIS} package will have a good first try to ensure
 a smooth working environment. \cr\cr 
 For a broad number of problems you may just use the \code{RQGIS} package as wrapper for the functionalitythat can 
 be reached via \code{QGIS}.
\code{link2GI} is tested under Windows 7/10 as well as on the Ubuntu/Debian Linux distributions. 
The OSX operation system should run but is not tested.
