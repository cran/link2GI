\title{Usually for internally usage get 'GRASS GIS' and \code{rgrass7} parameters on 'Windows' OS}
\usage{
paramGRASSw(set_default_GRASS7 = NULL, DL = "C:", ver_select = FALSE,
  quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{set_default_GRASS7}{default = NULL forces a full search for 'GRASS GIS' binaries. You may
alternatively provide a vector containing pathes and keywords. c("C:/OSGeo4W64","grass-7.0.5","osgeo4W") is valid for a typical osgeo4w installation.}

\item{DL}{raster or sp object}

\item{ver_select}{boolean default is FALSE. If there is more than one 'SAGA GIS' installation and \code{ver_select} = TRUE the user can select interactively the preferred 'SAGA GIS' version}

\item{quiet}{boolean if set to FALSE you will get most of the console messages}
}
\description{
Initialize the enviroment variables on a 'Windows' OS for using 
 'GRASS GIS' via \link{rgrass7}
}
\details{
The concept is very straightforward but for an all days usage pretty
 helpful. You need to provide a \link{raster} or a \link{sp} object. The derived properties are used to initialize a temporary but static
 \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgrass7}{rgrass7} environment. During the rsession you will have full access to
 GRASS7 both via the wrapper package as well as the command line. paramGRASSw initializes the usage of GRASS7.
